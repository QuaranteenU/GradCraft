# How to contribute
There's no strict guidelines, just try to follow the code style and folder structure that's already present in the repository. The team at QU has all used [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which has a free student license and a community edition if you're not a student), so using IntelliJ will ensure that code style stays consistent for the most part. Just use your best judgement, at the end of the day any issues can be caught during PR review.

## Things you could potentially add
- Right now the way the graduate NPCs traverse the stage is pretty jank, it uses a navigation ended hook and boolean flags to decide what actions to take/where to move next. Making the navigation more easily configurable/robust would be very helpful!
